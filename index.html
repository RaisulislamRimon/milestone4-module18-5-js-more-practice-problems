            <h4>1. What is JavaScript?</h4>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you
              to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page
              does more than just sit there and display static information for
              you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive
              maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. —
              you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
              layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which
              (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts
              of the Learning Area.

            <h4>2. How does JS Works?</h4>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a client-side scripting language and one of the most
              efficient, commonly used scripting languages. The term
              .client-side scripting language means that it runs at the
              client-side( or on the client machine) inside the web-browsers,
              but one important thing to remember is that client's web-browser
              also needs to support the JavaScript or it must be JavaScript
              enabled. Nowadays, most of the modern web browsers support
              JavaScript and have their JavaScript engines. For example, Google
              Chrome has its own JavaScript engine called V8.

            <h4>3. What is Variable?</h4>
            <p>
              A variable is a named reference to a value. That way an
              unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.
              <br />
              Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
              In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var
              keyword: Example var x = 5; var y = 6; var z = x + y;
            </p>

              JavaScript supports five different types of variable. These
              variable types are outlined in the following table together with
              examples and a brief description of each type: Type Example
              Description boolean true, false The boolean variable is used to
              record a value of either true or false. Internally this is
              essentially stored as 1 for true and 0 for false. number 1, -31,
              0.023 The number variable holds any type of number, either an
              integer or a real number. string "Hello World!" The string
              variable type stores a string of characters, typically making up
              either a word or sentence. string variables can also be assigned
              empty strings. function any built-in or user defined function A
              function is one of the basic building blocks of most programming
              languages including JavaScript. Functions provide a way to
              organize functionality into clean, reusable modules that can be
              accessed from any other JavaScript to perform specific tasks. In
              addition to user created functions, JavaScript contains a number
              of built-in functions that provide pre-defined functionality.
              Functions are covered in Understanding JavaScript Functions.
              object document, window JavaScript provides a set of predefined
              objects to which the JavaScript programmer has access. For example
              the document object refers to the current web page and can be
              accessed to make changes to the page content.

              JavaScript has different data types, primitive and non-primitive.
              There are seven primitive data types, Number, String, Boolean,
              NULL, Undefined and Symbol and one non-primitive data type
              ‘object’. There are differences between NULL and undefined data
              types though both contain the same value. Like other programming
              languages, JavaScript also has some in-built language errors or
              discrepancies which is found in the NULL data type and the data
              type of JavaScript functions.

              A variable name should accurately identify your variable. When you
              create good variable names, your JavaScript code becomes easier to
              understand and easier to work with. Properly naming variables is
              really important! Here are rules JavaScript has for naming
              variables: Variable names cannot contain spaces. Variable names
              must begin with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).
              Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or
              dollar signs. Variable names are case-sensitive. Certain words may
              not be used as variable names, because they have other meanings
              within JavaScript. Check out this complete list of the reserved
              words. You’ll be faced with many decisions when choosing how to
              name your variables: Do you want to begin your variable names with
              an uppercase letter or a lowercase letter, or do you want to use
              camelCase? Do you want to use multiple words within your variable
              names? Do you want to use an underscore (_) between the words in
              your variable name? (Remember: Variables can’t contain spaces.)
              Fortunately, you don’t have to make all these choices by yourself.
              Many professional programmers agree that there are best practices
              to keep in mind when naming your variables: Don’t use names that
              are too short. Simple one-letter names or names that don’t make
              sense are not a good option when naming variables. Use more than
              one word to name your variable. This will ensure your variable
              name is precise. When using more than one word in your variable
              names, always put the adjective to the left. For example, this is
              correct: var greenGrass. Pick a style for names with more than one
              word, and stick to it. The two most common ways to join words to
              create a name are camelCase and using an underscore (_).
              JavaScript is flexible — either method works.
